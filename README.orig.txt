====================================
  NOTES FOR THE 12-11-2008 VERSION
====================================

The main changes in this version are the following:

  * This version makes use of the Vertex Buffer Object extension, if
    available. Things should look *much* smoother on lower-end GPUs.
  * The annoying sound lag that was present in the previous version should
    be gone.
  * It's now possible to change the display resolution and switch between
    full-screen and windowed modes from the game menu.

This version should perform much better than the previous one. If things
still look a bit jumpy, changing the water detail to "Low" or "Medium",
under the "Display" menu, could help.

1. HOW TO INSTALL

  There's no installer yet. Just unpack the contents of this directory
  and run protozoa.exe.


2. HOW TO PLAY

  This game doesn't involve quests, puzzles, missions, strategy, or
  interaction with non-playable characters. Just shoot at anything
  that moves! The shiny hexagons are power-ups - collect them and get
  temporary super powers. Get enough points and make it to the high
  score table! Can YOU be number one?


3. CONTROLS

  Controls are set on the "Options" menu item. The options are:

  * KEYBOARD: a set of keys moves the ship, and another one controls the
    direction of fire.

  * KEYBOARD/MOUSE HYBRID: control the ship with keys, and the direction
    of fire with the mouse.

  * DUAL ANALOG JOYPAD: one of the sticks controls the ship, and the other
    one fires.


4. COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

  Not very user friendly, we know, but we were a bit short on time...

  -window        windowed mode.
  -fullscreen    fullscreen mode
  -nosound       disable sound.
  -sound         enable sound.


5. HAVE FUN!

  We hope you enjoy this game as much as we enjoyed making it. Cliche', maybe,
  but still true.

  Many thanks to Intel for promoting this contest, which provided the
  motivation for the existence of this game, and THANK YOU for choosing
  us as one of the finalists!
